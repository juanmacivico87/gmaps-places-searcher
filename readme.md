#Google Maps - Centers Searcher

A script to show a map and search for centers saved in a JSON.

It uses the Google Maps API for JavaScript, so for it to work it is necessary to have an API key for this tool.

The script has no defined style, only the one that causes the map to be displayed. Feel free to edit it and adapt it to the needs of your project.
